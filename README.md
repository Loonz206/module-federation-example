# Module Federation Example

scaffolding an example of a multiple application arch stitched together from this example. 

The purpose of this is to demonstrate seperate deployments for a larger team and leveraging bundled "remotes" to add components into views or components via some configuration in the `next.config.js`, so ideally teams can work independently and have remotes exposed to cross over applications. For more about this refer to

### Roadmap
